                <p>Fertilization is when the male sperm and female egg meet. This occurs in the fallopian tubes. When an egg is fertilized it is called a zygote. A zygote will continue traveling through the fallopian tubes to the uterus and implant in the endometrium (the lining of the uterus).

                <p>Every month, a female body prepares for pregnancy. In this cycle, an egg is released from an ovary and travels down a fallopian tube to the uterus. As this happens, the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, will fill with blood and nutrients. <br><br> If the egg does not meet with any sperm before it arrives in the uterus, no fertilization occurs. When no fertilization occurs, the lining of the uterus will shed and the cycle will begin again.</p>

                <p>Fraternal twins occur when two eggs are released from the ovaries instead of just one, and both meet with sperm in the fallopian tubes. When this happens, both eggs can be fertilized. <br><br> Those fertilized eggs are both called zygotes (dizygotic) and can move to the uterus and implant separately in the endometrium. Once implanted, the zygotes can continue to grow into two separate humans.</p>

                <p>Identical twins occur when one egg is released from an ovary and meets a sperm cell in the fallopian tube. This is called fertilization. The fertilized egg, or zygote, will begin to grow by dividing. <br><br> For identical twins, a zygote will not only divide, but split into two separate cells. Both of those cells will continue to move down the fallopian tube to the uterus, where they will implant in the endometrium and grow into two separate humans.

                <p>The egg cell (also called an ova) is the reproductive cell for a female body.  The sperm cell is the reproductive cell for a male body and has a head and a tail. <br><br> Though an egg cell and a sperm cell are different in many ways, they have one main thing in common: each reproductive cell contains DNA, the building blocks for a human.</p>
